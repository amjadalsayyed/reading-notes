# Python Scope

> - Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function or class have a global scope, which means they can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the program. To modify a global variable inside a function, you need to use the global keyword before the variable name.

> - Local Scope: Variables declared inside a function have a local scope, which means they can only be accessed and modified within that function.

> - Nonlocal Scope: Variables declared in a nested function can have a nonlocal scope, which means they can be accessed and modified in the parent function. To modify a nonlocal variable inside a nested function, you need to use the nonlocal keyword before the variable name.
