# Linear regression in Python

Linear regression in Python is a statistical modeling technique used to establish a linear relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target). It aims to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the distance between the predicted and actual values. By using Python libraries such as scikit-learn or statsmodels, you can create a linear regression model, fit it to your data, make predictions, and evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared.

- Import Libraries: Start by importing the necessary libraries. For linear regression, you'll typically need libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Load Data: Load or generate your dataset. Ensure that your data is in a format suitable for linear regression, with independent variables (features) and corresponding dependent variable (target).
- Split Data: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. This helps evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.
- Create and Fit Model: Create an instance of the linear regression model from the chosen library. Fit the model to the training data, allowing it to learn the underlying relationship between the features and the target variable.
- Predict: Once the model is trained, use it to make predictions on new, unseen data or the testing set.
- Evaluate: Assess the performance of the linear regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics. Common metrics for regression include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared
- Visualize: Visualize the results of the linear regression model, such as plotting the actual versus predicted values or the residuals.
