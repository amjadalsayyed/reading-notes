# Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.

In Next.js, static routes are created by placing individual files in the pages directory, representing pages with fixed content for specific URL paths. On the other hand, dynamic routes are defined using square brackets [ ] in the file names within the pages directory, allowing you to create pages with variable paths that depend on query parameters. Dynamic routes enable you to generate pages based on data and handle multiple pages with similar layouts but different content. The choice between static and dynamic routes depends on whether the page content remains constant or requires variation based on URL parameters. Next.js offers a flexible routing system that allows you to use both static and dynamic routes effectively in your application.

# Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?

To deploy a Next.js application, follow these steps:

Prepare your Next.js application for production. Build the application using the Next.js build command. Optionally, test the production build locally using the Next.js start command. Choose a deployment platform like Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, or Heroku. Configure the platform and specify build settings and environment variables. Initiate the deployment process from the chosen platform. Monitor the application's performance and scale if needed. Optionally, set up a custom domain for the deployed application.

# How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.

Next.js serves static files efficiently through a Content Delivery Network (CDN). By default, static assets like images and stylesheets are stored in the public folder in the project's root directory. To reference static assets in a Next.js application, use URLs starting with /, followed by the path to the asset relative to the public folder. During deployment, Next.js automatically serves these static assets from the public folder, ensuring optimal performance and caching for improved user experience.
