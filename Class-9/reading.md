# Dunder methods in Python

> Dunder methods in Python are special methods that start and end with double underscores ("dunders"). They are also known as "magic methods" or "special methods" because they provide special behavior to the objects that define them. Here are some of the most commonly used dunder methods in Python:

> - **init**(self, ...) - Initializes a newly created object and sets its initial attributes.
> - **str**(self) - Returns a string representation of the object.
> - **repr**(self) - Returns a string representation of the object that can be used to recreate it.
> - **len**(self) - Returns the length of the object.
> - **add**(self, other) - Defines the behavior of the + operator when applied to two objects.
> - **sub**(self, other) - Defines the behavior of the - operator when applied to two objects.
> - **eq**(self, other) - Defines the behavior of the == operator when applied to two objects.
> - **lt**(self, other) - Defines the behavior of the < operator when applied to two objects.
> - **gt**(self, other) - Defines the behavior of the > operator when applied to two objects.

> There are many other dunder methods available in Python, but these are some of the most commonly used ones. They allow Python objects to behave more like built-in types and enable powerful operator overloading, which can make code more concise and expressive.
