## Big O notation

> Big O notation is a way of describing the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It describes how the execution time or space used by an algorithm grows as the size of the input data set increases. O(1) represents constant time or space, O(N) represents linear time, O(NÂ²) represents quadratic time, and O(2^N) represents exponential time. Logarithms, represented by O(log N), are used to describe algorithms like binary search, which are very efficient when dealing with large data sets. A good understanding of Big O notation is important for making informed decisions when working with different data sets.

## Pain and Suffaring

> The Code Fellows 401 Python course is an accelerated learning environment that will push students mentally, emotionally, and physically, causing pain. However, pain is necessary for growth, and the pain experienced during the course will launch students forward into the next phase of their lives. It's important to differentiate between pain and suffering, with pain having a higher goal and purpose, while suffering does not. As students experience pain, they should seek remedies, ask questions, research, and build their resources and community. Ultimately, the pain experienced during the course is the callouses that students build while learning to use Python as a tool, and it's essential for becoming a skilled software developer.
