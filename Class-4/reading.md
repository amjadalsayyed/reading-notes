# Class-3 Reading Notes

## Classes and Objects

In Python, classes and objects are used to implement object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

> - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have.
> - To create an object, you instantiate a class by calling its constructor. The constructor creates an instance of the class and sets its initial state. You can then access the attributes and methods of the object using dot notation.

## Thinking Recursively

Thinking recursively means breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems that can be solved recursively. Here are the basic steps to think recursively in Python:

> - Identify the base case: This is the simplest possible version of the problem that can be solved without recursion.
> - Define the recursive case: This is the more complex version of the problem that can be solved by recursively breaking it down into smaller subproblems.
> - Call the function recursively: Call the function itself with the smaller subproblem as input, until the base case is reached.
