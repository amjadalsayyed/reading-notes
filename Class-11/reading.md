# Jupyter Lab

> Jupyter Lab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter, an open-source software ecosystem for interactive computing and data science. It builds upon the functionality of Jupyter Notebook, but also introduces new features and improvements. Here are some of the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab:

> - Multi-document interface: Unlike Jupyter Notebook, which allows only one notebook per browser tab, Jupyter Lab provides a tabbed interface that allows users to work with multiple documents (notebooks, code files, markdown files, etc.) in the same window.

> - Integrated terminal: Jupyter Lab includes a terminal emulator that allows users to run system commands, install packages, and access command-line tools from within the same environment.

> - Drag-and-drop interface: Jupyter Lab includes a drag-and-drop interface that allows users to rearrange and combine multiple notebooks and files in the same workspace.

> - Flexible layout: Jupyter Lab allows users to customize the layout of their workspace, including the arrangement of panes and tabs, and the size and position of each pane.

> - Extensions: Jupyter Lab supports a wide range of extensions that allow users to add new functionality, such as syntax highlighting, code folding, and code completion.

> - Collaboration: Jupyter Lab includes collaboration features that allow multiple users to work on the same notebook simultaneously, and to share notebooks and other files with each other.

> In summary, Jupyter Lab provides a more flexible and powerful user interface than Jupyter Notebook, with improved multi-document support, an integrated terminal, a drag-and-drop interface, customizable layouts, and a wide range of extensions. These features make it a more versatile tool for data scientists, programmers, and researchers who need to work with code, data, and documentation in an interactive and collaborative environment.
