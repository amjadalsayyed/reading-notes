# Linked list

> - A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a value and a reference to the next node in the list. There are two types of linked lists: singly linked lists, where each node only has a reference to the next node, and doubly linked lists, where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes.

> - To insert a node into a linked list, you must first create a new node with the desired value and set its reference to the next node. Then, you update the previous node's reference to point to the new node instead of the next node. To delete a node, you update the previous node's reference to point to the node after the deleted node.

> - Linked lists have several advantages over arrays, including dynamic sizing and efficient insertion and deletion operations. However, they have slower random access times and require more memory due to the need to store references.
